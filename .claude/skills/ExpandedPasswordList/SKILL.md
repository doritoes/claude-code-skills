# ExpandedPasswordList

Automated pipeline to extract real breach passwords from HIBP Pwned Passwords that supplement rockyou.txt.

## Nomenclature

```
ROCKS       →  Full HIBP Pwned Passwords (~1B SHA-1 hashes)
GRAVEL      →  ROCKS minus rockyou.txt matches (~985M hashes)
SAND        →  GRAVEL minus rockyou+OneRule cracked (hard passwords)
PEARLS      →  Cracked cleartext passwords (valuable output)
GLASS       →  Base words extracted from PEARLS (future: optimized wordlist)
UNOBTAINIUM →  Enhanced rule derived from PEARLS analysis (future: improved rule)
```

## Value Proposition

1. **PEARLS** - Real breach passwords NOT in rockyou (expanded wordlist)
2. **SAND** - Audit-worthy hashes that survive aggressive cracking
3. **HIBP Frequency** - Passwords sorted by occurrence count (most breached first)
4. **Self-maintaining** - Pipeline can be re-run as HIBP updates
5. **Feedback loop** - Cracked passwords enhance future attacks

## Quick Commands

```bash
# ============================================================================
# MONITORING & OPERATIONS (Use these FIRST for ongoing batches)
# ============================================================================

# Comprehensive pipeline health check (PREFERRED - reduces manual SQL)
bun Tools/PipelineMonitor.ts              # Full health checks (20s wait for chunk check)
bun Tools/PipelineMonitor.ts --quick      # Quick status only
bun Tools/PipelineMonitor.ts --fix        # Auto-fix simple issues
bun Tools/PipelineMonitor.ts --watch      # Continuous monitoring (60s interval)

# Safe task archiving with full validation
bun Tools/SafeArchiver.ts --check batch-0020     # Check batch before archiving
bun Tools/SafeArchiver.ts --batch batch-0020 --dry-run  # Preview archive
bun Tools/SafeArchiver.ts --batch batch-0020     # Archive batch
bun Tools/SafeArchiver.ts --task 150             # Archive single task

# ============================================================================
# BATCH SUBMISSION
# ============================================================================

# Submit new batches for cracking
bun Tools/CrackSubmitter.ts --batch 17 --workers 8   # Submit batch 17 with 8 workers
bun Tools/CrackSubmitter.ts --batch 17 --workers 8 --priority 90  # Override priority

# ============================================================================
# INITIAL SETUP (Run once)
# ============================================================================

# Download HIBP (ROCKS) - batched storage recommended
bun Tools/HibpDownloader.ts --batched --parallel 10

# Filter to GRAVEL (preserves HIBP occurrence counts)
bun Tools/SetDifference.ts --batched --compress

# ============================================================================
# RESULTS
# ============================================================================

# Collect results
bun Tools/ResultCollector.ts

# Prioritize PEARLS by HIBP frequency (most breached first)
bun Tools/PearlPrioritizer.ts          # Full prioritized list
bun Tools/PearlPrioritizer.ts --top 10000   # Top 10K most common
bun Tools/PearlPrioritizer.ts --analyze     # Count distribution
```

## Cracking Pipeline (SAND → PEARLS)
